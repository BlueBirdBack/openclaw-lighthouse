# OpenClaw Lighthouse

From OpenClaw headaches to working fixes.

## What this repo is
A practical field notebook for OpenClaw issues we actually hit in real use, plus the shortest known fixes/workarounds.

## Structure
- `docs/index.md` — master index
- `docs/issues/` — problem reports (symptoms + repro)
- `docs/fixes/` — solved writeups (root cause + fix)

## Entry template
Each note should include:
1. Symptoms
2. Environment (OpenClaw version / OS / channel)
3. Reproduction steps
4. Root cause
5. Fix / workaround
6. Status (fixed local / upstream / pending)
7. Links (issue/PR/logs)
